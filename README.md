Untitled Word Game Pro is a Wordle clone for 8-bit Apple II computers. It runs on any Apple ][ with 64K. It runs under ProDOS and can be copied to a hard drive if you like that sort of thing.

The game is fully playable and feature-complete. It randomly picks from a curated list of 2048 five-letter words and validates your guesses against a list of 9330 words. There is no "daily" play, just random puzzles as long as your Apple II can draw breath. It even plays a little tune when you win.
